Analysis of bioelectrical signals recorded in the Laboratory of Bioelectrical Signals.

* EMG - Electromyography is a diagnostic procedure to assess the health of muscles and the nerve cells that control them (motor neurons). EMG results can reveal nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with nerve-to-muscle signal transmission. This EMG was recorded on patient's arm and face.

* EKG - Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). It is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin. Implementation is focused on Einthoven and Goldberg montage, Wave analysis, HRV analysis - Resting state, Stressed state, Physical activity.

* EOG - Electrooculography is a technique for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye. The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. Primary applications are in ophthalmological diagnosis and in recording eye movements. Processing was focused on saccade detection using various methods. You can view this part of analysis here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GXSydgunR5LtYS7KrFfp4nZ5TiSd8Jww?usp=sharing
